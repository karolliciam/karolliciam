### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Coding has always sparked an interest in my life. I am excited for everyone to take a look at my repos. Python has always been a language I love working on because of its complexity. Front end progamming has taught me to be a logical thinker and to really manage my time. I hope to deveop websites in the future.
